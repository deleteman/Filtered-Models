Introduction
-------------------------

Rails 3 plugin which adds extra functionalities to the AtiveRecord class, allowing the developer
to use filter methods that behave like the action filters for the Controllers.

Implemented filter:

- after_filter, before_filter

They both support the following forms:

before_filter :method
before_filter :method, :only => [:method1, :method2]
before_filter :method, :only => [:method1, :method2] do |m| 
	#code here (m is the model)
end
before_filter :only => [:method1, :method2] do |m| 
	#code here (m is the model)
end



Installation
-------------------------
In order to install this plugin, it should be enough to just copy the entire folder under vendor/plugins.



Use example
-------------------------

class Test < ActiveRecord::base
	before_filter :filter_method, :only => [:filtered_method]
	after_filter :last_method, :only => [:filtered_method]
	after_filter :always

	def always
		#this method will be called after every single method defined here, except itself
	end
	def filter_method 
		# your filter code here
	end

	def filtered_method
		#  your code here
	end

	def last_method
		#this code will execute always after a method is invoked
	end
end


TODO's
-------------------------

- Implement the ":except" clause
- Hard testing
